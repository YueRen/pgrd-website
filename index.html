    <p>
      The Durham Maths postgraduate research day is a celebration of the research being done by postgraduates in the department. It is an opportunity for students and postdocs to present their work to their peers via short accessible talks and to learn about the research being done by others.

    <h2>Abstracts</h2>
		<h4>Finn Gagliano - Categorical Symmetries and Phases Transitions</h4>
		<p>
			In the past decade, there has been a major shift in the way physicists view the symmetries of a quantum field theory. Extending the usual group-theoretical notion of a symmetry, categorical symmetries have led to new insights in many different areas of quantum field theory. In this talk, I will discuss one particular aspect, namely how we can use the tools of category theory to distinguish (de)confined phases of gauge theories.

		<h4>Rafail Psyroukis - From classical to Siegel modular forms</h4>
		<p>
			In this talk, we will discuss how the classical theory of modular forms generalises to the theory of Siegel modular forms. We will present analogues for both cases but also discuss fundamental differences, which makes the theory of Siegel modular forms so interesting to explore.
		</p>

		<h4>Julio Ignacio Quijas Aceves - Constructing fundamental Polyhedra for Complex Hyperbolic Space</h4>
		<p>
			Given a geodesic triangle in hyperbolic space with rational angles, we can construct a discrete group by taking the group generated by reflections on the sides of the triangle. This leads to the well-known beautiful triangular tessellations of the hyperbolic plane. We generalize this construction to the Complex Hyperbolic plane, where the construction increases in complexity due to the non-constant curvature of the Complex Hyperbolic plane.

    <h4>Adam Stone - AddiVortes: (Bayesian) Additive Voronoi Tessellations</h4>
    <p>
      Many statistical models, such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Machines, and Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), rely on decision trees to partition the covariate space. While effective, tree-based methods often struggle due to their rigid structure and limited flexibility in capturing relationships between features. We introduce AddiVortes, a novel model that uses Voronoi tessellations instead of decision trees for more adaptive partitioning. AddiVortes builds on BART's framework, with performance demonstrated through comparisons on multiple datasets and simulations verifying its properties. By leveraging Voronoi tessellations, AddiVortes is able to capture complex relationships, offering a powerful and interpretable alternative to traditional tree-based models.

		<h4>Lupeng Zhang - Some discussions and proposals for high dimensional change point detection</h4>
		<p>
			Change point analysis aims to detect significant changes in the distribution of a data sequence. It holds critical importance across modern statistical applications such as economics, finance, quality control, genetics, and medical research. While change point detection for low dimensional data is thoroughly studied in extensive literature, change point detection is challenging in high dimensional data where the number of variables is much larger than the number of observations. Hence high dimensional change point analysis has become a vital focus of recent research. In the present work, we discuss some main challenges with high dimensional change points and introduce a nonparametric approach to deal with those challenges. The proposed method applies  the dissimilarity distance and cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistics to detect high dimensional change points. It can detect changes in both the mean and variance of high  dimensional observations, as well as other distributional changes. We also present its  simulation results and data application on the S&P index to demonstrate its effectiveness in addressing challenges for high dimensional data.

		<h4>Yanpeng Zhi - Why People Get Lazy in the Long Run?</h4>
		<p>
			Being lazy seems inevitable as humans, and we are not tireless robots after all. In this talk, I will defend ourselves by considering an ergodic control problem. It can be proved that an optimal control turns out of a lazy type. This provides mathematical evidence for our daily behaviour.
